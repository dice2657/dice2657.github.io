    <p>"What makes Jamal Murray stand out above all other players I have watched on the Denver Nuggets?"</p>
    <p>"The folowing are the reasons that make Jamal Murray extraordinary in my mind:"</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Grit and determination in the face of adversity"</li>
      <li>"A strong faith in his training and abilities as a professional basketball player"</li>
      <li>"The ability to not be willing to accept defeat as something that is okay"</li>
      <li>"The strength to stand up for what he believes in on and off the court"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>"During his career so far, Jamal Murray has been a prime example of a clutch player. He leads his team through tough games; he encourages those around him to not accept mediocrity; he fights to be a better player each and every day. This is truly inspirational to me."</p>
