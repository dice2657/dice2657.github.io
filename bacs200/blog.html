        <p>US President Joe Biden's major campaign promise was to defeat COVID-19 and return the American public to a normal life with a prospering economy.<br>
          It is my contention that he has failed in this regard.</p>

        <h2>Social Implications</h2>
        <p>During his first year in office, President Joe Biden has imposed federal mask mandates, pushed American businesses to fire employees over their vaccine 
          status, regardless of the fact that the vaccine mandate was legally deemed unconstitutional. There have been more COVID-19 cases, as well as COVID-19 deaths 
          since he has taken over as president than in the previous year. These actions have caused a deeper divide in the American public, as a mask is now 
          seen as a political symbol and is used regardless of the science. Some people have even said that they still wear a mask because they do not want to 
          "look like a Republican". I believe his lack of leadership is what has deepened the divide in the country.</p>

        <h2>Economic Implications</h2>
        <p>Joe Biden inherited an economy that was on the path towards booming, despite the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reimposed mandates and 
          strict guidance for businesses, as well as the canceling of the new Keystone Pipeline project under the previous administration has strangled the 
          economy and has left it in a stagnant state of high inflation. These inflating costs are beginning to affect American consumers, as well as having an 
          impact on the supply chain. I believe that Joe Biden's large amount of spending is what has held back the US economy beyond the effects of a pandemic.</p>

        <h2>Political Implications</h2>
        <p>President Joe Biden's characterization of the Republican party as careless, privileged people in front of the American public due to their 
          unwillingness to mask up in public has caused a strong political divide in the country. More people have become entrenched in the Democrat or 
          Republican party talking points. This has caused a deeper divide as well within Congress, as both parties tend to vote unanimously in polarized fashion. 
          I believe that these divides were started by previous presidents, but have deepened rapidly during Joe Biden's presidency.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> I contend that Joe Biden has failed to accomplish his campaign's promise to defeat COVID-19 and return the American public to a normal life with a prospering economy.
          He has imposed mandates, lost people their jobs over vaccine mandates, spent large amounts of money to inflate the economy, and deeply divided the American people 
          on fundamental issues. I do not believe this is representative of his campaign promises, but instead is a representation of his lack of integrity and leadership 
          capabilities.</p>
