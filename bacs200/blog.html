        <p>US President Joe Biden's major campaign promise was to defeat COVID-19 and return the American public to a normal life with a prospering economy.<br>
          It is my contention that he has failed in this regard.</p>

        <h2>Social Implications</h2>
        <p>During his first year in office, President Joe Biden has imposed federal mask mandates, pushed American businesses to fire employees over their vaccine <br>
          status, regardless of the fact that the vaccine mandate was legally deemed unconstitutional. There have been more COVID-19 cases, as well as COVID-19 deaths <br>
          since he has taken over as president than in the previous year. These actions have caused a deeper divide in the American public, as a mask is now <br>
          seen as a political symbol and is used regardless of the science. Some people have even said that they still wear a mask because they do not want to <br>
          "look like a republican". I believe his lack of leadership is what has deepened the divide in the country.</p>

        <h2>Economic Implications"</h2>
        <p>Joe Biden inherited an economy that was on the path towards booming, despite the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reimposed mandates and <br>
          strict guidance for businesses, as well as the canceling of the new Keystone Pipeline project under the previous administration has strangled the <br>
          economy and has left it in a stagnant state of high inflation. These inflating costs are beginning to affect American consumers, as well as having an <br>
          impact on the supply chain. I believe that Joe Biden's large amount of spending is what has held back the US economy beyond the effects of a pandemic.</p>

        <h2>Political Implications</h2>
        <p>President Joe Biden's characterization of the republican party as careless, privileged people in front of the American public due to their <b>
          unwillingness to mask up in public has caused a strong political divide in the country. More people have become entrenched in the Democrat or <br>
          Republican party talking points. This has caused a deeper divide as well within Congress, as both parties tend to vote unanimously in polarized fashion. <br>
          I believe that these divides were started by previous presidents, but have deepened rapidly during Joe Biden's presidency.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> I contend that Joe Biden has failed to accomplish his campaign's promise to defeat COVID-19 and return the American public to a normal life with a prospering economy. <br>
          He has imposed mandates, lost people their jobs over vaccine mandates, spent large amounts of money to inflate the economy, and deeply divided the American people <br>
          on fundamental issues. I do not believe this is representative of his campaign promises, but instead is a representation of his lack of integrity and leadership <br>
          capabilities</p>
